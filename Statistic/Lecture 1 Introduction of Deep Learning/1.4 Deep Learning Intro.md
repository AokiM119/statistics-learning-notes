### Up and Downs of Deep Learning

### Three Steps for Deep Learning

### Step 1: Neural Network Definition

Fully Connect Feedforward Network
Deep = Many hidden layers
Matrix Operation
Output Layer
Example Application

FAQ:
- How many layers? How many neurons for each layer?
- Can the structure be automatically determined?
- Can we design the network structure?

### Step 2: Goodness of Function (Network)
Loss for an Example
 
Total Loss

Backpropagation 
### Step 3: Pick the best Function (Network)

Concluding Remarks
What are the benefits of deep architecture?
Deep is better?
Universality Theorem
Why deep neural network instead of fat neural network?

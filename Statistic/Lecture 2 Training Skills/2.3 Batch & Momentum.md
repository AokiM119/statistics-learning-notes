Gradient Descend + Momentum

Movement: movement of last step minus gradient at present.
在每个点move的方向，不再完全由该点的gradient决定，而也与上一个点的movement方向向量有关系。

Movement not just based on gradient, but previous movement as well.

在梯度下降的过程中，加入了惯性因子，进行下降行为的平衡。

Concluding remarks:
- Critical points have zero gradients
- Critical points can be either saddle points or local minima
	- The type could be determined by Hessian matrix
	- It is possible to escape saddle points along the direction of the eigenvetors of the Hessian matrix. 
	- Local minima could be rare.
- Smaller batch size and momentum could help escape critical points.
